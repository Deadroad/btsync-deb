BitTorrent Sync Debianoid Packaging
===================================

[BitTorrent&reg; Sync][1] from BitTorrent&reg; Inc. is a simple tool that
applies p2p protocol for direct live folder sync with maximum security, network
speed and storage capacity. It has native versions for Mac, Windows and Linux,
as well as native NAS integration.

BitTorrent&reg; Inc. __delivers for Linux users only a raw binary file without
any deployment concept or setup system__. It's up to the user to create a
reliable startup and shutdown logic and to manage a configuration file. Also a
dedicated GUI, as provided for Windows and Mac OSX is missing.

The scope of this project is to provide a __Linux GUI__ with all features as in
Windows and Mac OSX and easy to install packages both for servers and desktop
systems.

**THESE SOFTWARE IS UNOFFICIAL AND NOT THE WORK OF BITTORRENT&reg; INC.
PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT THE BITTORRENT&reg; INC. SUPPORT WITH QUESTIONS OR
PROBLEMS RELATED TO THE USE OF THE PACKAGES. YOU WILL FIND COMPETENT HELP
AND SUPPORT IN THE RELATED DISCUSSION THREAD IN THE SUPPORT FORUM (Links
below)**

The mere executables and documentation provided by BitTorrent&reg; Inc. are
distributed in a package named __btsync-common__ - all other packages are
dependent upon it.

The brand new package containing the full featured GUI for BitTorrent Sync for
desktop users is named __btsync-gui__ - This package is going to replace
__btsync-user__ on long term.

The package containing support for BitTorrent Sync as a single or multiple
service with or without WebUI for server/NAS deployment is named __btsync__

The legacy package containing support for BitTorrent Sync as a WebUI and tray
application for desktop users is named __btsync-user__

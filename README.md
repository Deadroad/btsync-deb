BitTorrent Sync Debianoid Packaging
===================================

[BitTorrent&reg; Sync][1] from BitTorrent&reg; Inc. is a simple tool that
applies p2p protocol for direct live folder sync with maximum security, network
speed and storage capacity. It has native versions for Mac, Windows and Linux,
as well as native NAS integration.

BitTorrent&reg; Inc. delivers only the raw binaries for Linux. The scope of
this project is to provide everything needed to create ready to use packages
for Debian based servers and workstations.

The mere executables and documentation provided by BitTorrent&reg; Inc. are
distributed in a package named __btsync-common__ - all other packages are
dependent upon it.

The package containing support for BitTorrent Sync as a single or multiple
service with or without WebUI for server/NAS deployment is named __btsync__

The package containing support for BitTorrent Sync as a WebUI and tray
application for desktop users is named __btsync-user__

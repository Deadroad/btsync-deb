BitTorrent Sync Debianoid Packaging
===================================

[BitTorrent&reg; Sync][1] from BitTorrent&reg; Inc. is a simple tool that
applies p2p protocol for direct live folder sync with maximum security, network
speed and storage capacity. It has native versions for Mac, Windows and Linux,
as well as native NAS integration.

BitTorrent&reg; Inc. **delivers only the raw binaries for Linux without any
GUI**. The scope of this project is to provide everything needed to create
ready to use packages for Debian based servers and workstations.

**THESE PACKAGES ARE UNOFFICIAL AND NOT THE WORK OF BITTORRENT&reg; INC.
PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT THE BITTORRENT&reg; INC. SUPPORT WITH QUESTIONS OR

The mere executables and documentation provided by BitTorrent&reg; Inc. are
distributed in a package named __btsync-common__ - all other packages are

application for desktop users is named __btsync-user__

The brand new package containing the full featured GUI for BitTorrent Sync for
desktop users is named __btsync-gui__ - This package is going to replace
__btsync-user__ on long term.

service with or without WebUI for server/NAS deployment is named __btsync__

==================

The BitTorrent Sync GUI was written by Leo Moll <leo.moll@yeasoft.com>

### Main Inspiration ###

I would like to thank Mark Johnson <mark@barrenfrozenwasteland.com> for writing
[`btsyncindicator.py`][1] which made a consistent part of the success of
`btsync-user` and gave me the last nudge needed to learn python and write my
first linux GUI application. Thank you!

### Contributions ###

The following people have contributed with code and/or good ideas:

1. Brandon Ingalls <blingall@mtu.edu> for his [BtSyncAPI][2] Python bindings
which inspired me in writing my own binding class

2. Harvey Mittens for his [Pull Request #42][3] to Mark's indicator which
inspired me to implement my own abstraction class

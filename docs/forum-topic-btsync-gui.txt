[color=#008000][b]BTSYNC DESKTOP GUI FOR ARCH, DEBIAN, UBUNTU AND OTHER DERIVED DISTRIBUTIONS[/b][/color]

If you are using Arch Linux, Ubuntu, Debian, Raspian or other derived distributions based on Debian and you are searching for an easy way to deploy BitTorrent Sync on your systems, this topic is definitively for you. Here you will find information about a family of easy to install packages that offer both a solution for the need of typical server/cloud operators as for interactive users.

The [b]desktop gui packages[/b] are explicitly intended for [b]desktop usage[/b] and provide a user experience similar to BitTorrent Sync on Windows or Mac OSX by still giving the user the possibility to customise his installation if he has special needs.

This topic covers only the [b]desktop user packages[/b]. If you are searching for the [b]server packages,[/b] [url=http://forum.bittorrent.com/topic/18974-debian-and-ubuntu-server-packages-for-bittorrent-sync/][b]please look here[/b][/url].

[color=#ff0000][b]THESE PACKAGES ARE UNOFFICIAL AND NOT THE WORK OF BITTORRENT® INC. PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT THE BITTORRENT® INC. SUPPORT WITH QUESTIONS OR PROBLEMS RELATED TO THE USE OF THE PACKAGES. YOU WILL FIND COMPETENT HELP AND SUPPORT IN THE SUPPORT FORUM[/b][/color]


[color=#008000][b]INSTALLATION ON ARCH LINUX[/b][/color]

The Arch Linux Package in the AUR is maintained by Martin Wimpress (@flexiondotorg). The package is named [font=courier new,courier,monospace][b]btsync-gui[/b][/font] and can be installed from the AUR using your favourite package manager. e.g.: if you are using [url=https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/yaourt]yaourt[/url]:
[code]
sudo yaourt -S btsync-gui
[/code]

When you have finished installing, you can skip the next section below and move directly to the [b]USAGE NOTES[/b].


[color=#008000][b]INSTALLATION ON DEBIAN, UBUNTU, LINUX MINT, RASPBIAN OR OTHER DEBIAN DERIVATES[/b][/color]

The most easy and fast way to install the repository is to paste that at a terminal prompt:
[code]
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL http://debian.yeasoft.net/add-btsync-repository.sh)"
[/code]
 
The script explains what it will do and then pauses before it does it asking for your permission. If you encounter any problems or prefer to do it manually, please [b][url=http://www.yeasoft.com/site/projects:btsync-deb:btsync-repo]look here[/url][/b].

Now update the package index and install [font=courier new,courier,monospace][b]btsync-gui[/b][/font] by pasting that at a terminal prompt:
[code]
`which sudo` apt-get update
`which sudo` apt-get install btsync-gui
[/code]

On some systems the [font=courier new,courier,monospace][b]AppIndicator library[/b][/font] is not available or maybe you do not want to use it. In this case, you may want to install the GTK only version of the BitTorrent Sync GUI instead:
[code]
`which sudo` apt-get update
`which sudo` apt-get install btsync-gui-gtk
[/code]
 
but you can do this only if you are using a GTK based desktop like Gnome on Debian. [color=#b22222][b]THIS WILL DEFINITIVELY NOT WORK WITH DESKTOPS LIKE UNITY![/b][/color] If you are in doubt, install [b][font=courier new,courier,monospace]btsync-gui[/font][/b] - this will work for sure!

After the successful installation, you have to initially start BitTorrent Sync. You have various possibilities to do this:
[LIST]
[*]Log out and login again. Since BitTorrent Sync is started on logon, it will start automatically.[/*]
[*]Select [i]BitTorrent Sync[/i] from the menu or Unity-Launcher[/*]
[/LIST]

[color=#800080][b]USAGE NOTES[/b][/color]

The BitTorrent Sync GUI aims to be a clone of the original BitTorrent Sync application on Windows and Mac OSX and to replace on long term the legacy package [font=courier new,courier,monospace][b]btsync-user[/b][/font].

The GUI provides two modes of operation:
[LIST]
[*][b]Standalone Mode[/b]: This is the default mode. When the GUI starts, an underlaying BitTorrent Sync agent is started too providing an overall experience similar to the GUI applications on Windows or Mac OSX.[/*]
[*][b]Client Mode[/b]: The GUI can be started from the command line with parameters specifying a connection to a remote BitTorrent Sync system. In this case, the GUI does not start a local BitTorrent Sync agent, but connects to an already running agent at a remote location. [b]This will work only, if the remote agent has activated API access by specifying a valid API key in the configuration file.[/b][/*]
[/LIST]

The behaviour of the GUI can be influenced by specifying various options on the command line. There is also a way to make some options persistent across restarts making it superfluous to specify the options each time you start the GUI. You can get detailed help about the commandline options by invoking the man page:
[code]
man btsync-gui
[/code]

Here an overview of the available options:
[code]
usage: btsync-gui [-h] [--log {CRITICAL,ERROR,WARNING,INFO,DEBUG}]
                  [--host HOST] [--port PORT] [--username USERNAME]
                  [--password PASSWORD] [--bindui BINDUI] [--webui]
                  [--savedefaults] [--cleardefaults]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --log {CRITICAL,ERROR,WARNING,INFO,DEBUG}
                        Sets the logging level. By default the logging level
                        is WARNING
  --host HOST           Hostname for the connection to BitTorrent Sync. If not
                        specified, a local BitTorrent Sync agent will be
                        launched.
  --port PORT           Optional port number for the connection to BitTorrent
                        Sync. If not specified, port 8888 is taken for a
                        connection to a remote BitTorrent Sync agent or (8999
                        + uid) is taken when creating a locally lauched agent.
                        This option can be made persistent for local agents
                        with --savedefaults
  --username USERNAME   Optional user name for connecting to a remote
                        BitTorrent Sync agent or username to use when creating
                        a locally launched agent. This option can be made
                        persistent for local agents with --savedefaults
  --password PASSWORD   Optional password for connecting to a remote
                        BitTorrent Sync agent or username to use when creating
                        a locally launched agent. This option can be made
                        persistent for local agents with --savedefaults
  --bindui BINDUI       Optional bind address for the Web UI of a locally
                        created BitTorrent Sync agent. By default the agent
                        binds to 127.0.0.1. If you want the Web UI of the
                        agent to be reachable by other computers, specify one
                        of the available IP addresses of this computer or
                        "all" to bind to all available adapters. This option
                        can be made persistent for local agents with
                        --savedefaults
  --webui               Include the Web UI in the menu. This option can be
                        made persistent with --savedefaults
  --savedefaults        If specified, the optionally supplied credentials,
                        bind address and port will be stored as default in the
                        application preferences and used when launching a
                        local BitTorrent Sync agent.
  --cleardefaults       If specified, all internally stored credentials, bind
                        address and port information will be cleared from the
                        application preferences.

[/code]

The usage of the command line options will be explained by some examples below.

[color=#800080][b]STANDALONE MODE[/b][/color]

By default there is no way to access the Web UI provided by the BitTorrent Sync agent, since the agent itself defines at each start random credentials to protect the system. If you still want to access the Web UI, you can activate an extended menu option by specifying [font=courier new,courier,monospace][b]--webui[/b][/font] on the command line. You will then have an additional menu item, that invokes a browser and connects you to the Web UI.

If you want to make this setting persistent, you can invoke the following command from the console:

[code]
btsync-gui --webui --savedefaults
[/code]

This makes the setting persistent, and you will not need to specify it again at each start.

Sometimes it may happen, that you want to access your running BitTorrent Sync agent from another computer via the Web UI or a [font=courier new,courier,monospace][b]btsync-gui[/b][/font] in Client Mode. By default this is not possible, because of two reasons:
[LIST]
[*]The BitTorrent Sync agent binds the administration interface only to the loopback adapter making it possible to connect only from the same machine (This is a security feature).[/*]
[*]The BitTorrent Sync agent is started at every time with randomly generated credentials. Without knowing them, it is impossible to access the administration interface of the agent (This is also a security feature).[/*]
[/LIST]

For users that want to access their system from another computer, there is still a possibility to configure the GUI in a way that makes the agent accessible also from other computers. In order to do so, the following parameters must be changed:
[LIST]
[*]The BitTorrent Sync agent must bind his administrative interface to all adapters of the system or an adapter reachable from outside.[/*]
[*]The BitTorrent Sync agent must bind his administrative interface to a well known port. By default the port is the sum of 8999 and the [font=courier new,courier,monospace][b]uid[/b][/font] of the user.[/*]
[*]The credentials must be set to something known.[/*]
[/LIST]

The GUI can be launched in such a mode, by specifying the following parameters:
 
[code]
btsync-gui --bindui 0.0.0.0 --port 10888 --username Leopoldo --password SuperSecret
[/code]

This configures the BitTorrent Sync agent to bind on all interfaces on port 10888 and to be accessible with the user name "Leopoldo" and the password "SuperSecret".

Also these settings can be made persistent by adding the option [font=courier new,courier,monospace][b]--savedefaults[/b][/font]

[b][color=#b22222]WARNING[/color]:[/b] as every comfort function, you pay the comfort by lowering the security. Remember: the product of comfort and security is a constant. You cannot increase both.

[color=#800080][b]CLIENT MODE[/b][/color]

In client mode, the GUI can be used to access a remotely running BitTorrent Sync agent. The only prerequisites are that the remote BitTorrent Sync agent is reachable from your computer, you know the credentials and the API access is enabled on the remote agent. You can also use the GUI to connect to another machine where a BitTorrent Sync GUI is running in standalone mode, if you have configured access possibilities like shown in the example above.

The connection to a remote BitTorrent Sync agent is done by entering the following command:

[code]
btsync-gui --host myserver.example.com --port 8888 --username Leopoldo --password SuperSecret
[/code]

If you are able to access the Web UI of a remote BitTorrent Sync system, you should know everything you need to also launch successfully the GUI.

Since the connection to remote systems is slower, you will notice the following limitations:
[LIST]
[*]The refresh rate is slower. It adapts dynamically to the overall performance.[/*]
[*]During the status refreshes, the GUI may be a bit unresponsive.[/*]
[*]There are no local file system checks, when you add a new folder. You must be sure, that you enter a valid path on the remote machine.[/*]
[*]Some features are disabled (Pause/resume, Enable/Disable Debug) since they are not feasible on remote systems.[/*]
[/LIST]

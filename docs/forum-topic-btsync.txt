[color=#4b0082][b]BTSYNC PACKAGES FOR DEBIAN, UBUNTU AND OTHER DERIVED DISTRIBUTIONS[/b][/color]

If you are using Ubuntu, Debian, Raspian or other derived distributions based on Debian and you are searching for an easy way to deploy BitTorrent Sync on your systems, this topic is definitively for you. Here you will find information about a family of easy to install deb-packages that offers both a solution for the need of typical server/cloud operators as for interactive users.

The [b]server packages[/b] offer full debconf-support for the automated creation and maintenance of an optional default configuration as well as the possibility to manually configure single or multiple BitTorrent Sync instances with highly customised configurations.

The [b]desktop user packages[/b] are explicitly intended for [b]desktop usage[/b] and provide a user experience similar to BitTorrent Sync on Windows or Mac OSX by still giving the user the possibility to customise his installation if he has special needs.

This topic covers only the [b]server packages[/b]. If you are searching for the [b]desktop user packages,[/b]  [url="http://forum.bittorrent.com/topic/19560-debian-and-ubuntu-desktop-packages-for-bittorrent-sync/"][b]please look here[/b][/url].

[color=#ff0000][b]THESE PACKAGES ARE UNOFFICIAL AND NOT THE WORK OF BITTORRENT® INC. PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT THE BITTORRENT® INC. SUPPORT WITH QUESTIONS OR PROBLEMS RELATED TO THE USE OF THE PACKAGES. YOU WILL FIND COMPETENT HELP AND SUPPORT IN THIS THREAD[/b][/color]

The deb-packages are available for the same architectures as released by BitTorrent Inc.:

[LIST]
[*][b]i386[/b] Intel/AMD 32 Bit[/*]
[*][b]amd64[/b] Intel/AMD 64 Bit[/*]
[*][b]armel[/b] ARM EABI[/*]
[*][b]armhf[/b] ARM hard float[/*]
[*][b]powerpc[/b] PowerPC[/*]
[/LIST]

Since the packages still have not been tested on every platform, any related feedback is highly appreciated.


[color=#FF8C00][b]BUG REPORTS, CONTRIBUTION AND SOURCES[/b][/color]

If you want to contribute to the development of the packages or if you are curious how this all works, you may find the current sources of the deployment scripts and packaging on GitHub under the following URL: [b]https://github.com/tuxpoldo/btsync-deb[/b]
If you have experienced a reproducible issue that [b]is related to the packaging and not to BitTorrent Sync itself[/b] you are strongly encouraged to [url="https://github.com/tuxpoldo/btsync-deb/issues"]open an issue on the project's GitHub Page[/url]. Issues related to the native functionality of BitTorrent Sync should rather by creating a new topic or partecipating to an already existing topic in the [url="http://forum.bittorrent.com/forum/56-bittorrent-sync/"]BitTorrent Sync Forum[/url].


[color=#008000][b]ADDING THE REPOSITORIES[/b][/color]

Debian and Debian based distributions (Linspire, Xandros, Ubuntu, and Mepis to name a few) use a tool called APT (Advanced Packaging Tool) to manage all software on the system. The term "package" refers to an individual file with a .deb extension that contains either all or part of an application.

Your distribution comes with some default repositories that are already setup, but these contain only the software officially distributed by the creator of your distribution. In order to install the btsync packages, you have to add the specific repositories where btsync is hosted.

[b]If you are using Ubuntu[/b], you may also use the Launchpad PPA instead of the default repositories. Although it is easier to install, there are some disadvantages:

[LIST=1]
[*]The PPA only supports Ubuntu versions that are supported (currently lucid, precise, quantal, raring and saucy)[/*]
[*]The PPA only supports the [b]i386[/b] and [b]amd64[/b] architectures[/*]
[*]Sometimes it takes some hours for the packages to be published[/*]
[/LIST]

If you are OK with this, you can add the Launchpad PPA by issuing the following commands:
[code]
`which sudo` add-apt-repository ppa:tuxpoldo/btsync
`which sudo` apt-get update
[/CODE]

After this, you can directly proceed with the installation.

[b]If you are not using Ubuntu or you are using an unsupported version or architecture or by any other reason you prefer the default repositories, continue here.[/b]

The btsync packages are all signed with a key in order to guarantee their authenticity. Before using the repository, you should add the key to the package manager. To do that, run the following command:
[code]
`which sudo` apt-key adv --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 6BF18B15
[/code]

On success you should see an output like this:
[code]
gpg: requesting key 6BF18B15 from hkp server keys.gnupg.net
gpg: key 6BF18B15: public key "Leo Moll <leo.moll@yeasoft.com>" imported
gpg: no ultimately trusted keys found
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1
[/code]

Now you can easily add the package sources, by executing the following commands:
[code]
CODENAME=$(lsb_release -cs | sed -n '/lucid\|precise\|quantal\|raring\|saucy\|trusty\|squeeze\|wheezy\|jessie\|sid/p')
echo deb http://debian.yeasoft.net/btsync ${CODENAME:-sid} main > ~/btsync.list
echo deb-src http://debian.yeasoft.net/btsync ${CODENAME:-sid} main >> ~/btsync.list
unset CODENAME
`which sudo` mv ~/btsync.list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/btsync.list
`which sudo` chown root:root /etc/apt/sources.list.d/btsync.list
[/code]

Remember to update the local cache:
[code]
`which sudo` apt-get update
[/code]

After that you can proceed with the installation.


[color=#008000][b]INSTALLATION OF BTSYNC[/b][/color]

The installation of btsync is really easy:
[code]
`which sudo` apt-get install btsync
[/code]

After downloading the packages, the installation begins. The package manager will ask you, if you want a default instance of btsync to be created. If you say [b]yes[/b], you will be guided through the installation and at the end you will have a fully operational btsync daemon maintained by debconf. The configuration can be modified and fine tuned at any time by performing the following command:
[code]
`which sudo` dpkg-reconfigure btsync
[/code]

Here you can select also delete the default instance, by answering [b]no[/b] to the question if you want a default instance to be created.

Beside the presence of a default instance of btsync, the advanced administrator will be able, to create many instances of btsync, by creating configuration files in the directory [b][font=courier new', courier, monospace]/etc/btsync[/font][/b]

More details can be found in the usages notes:


[color=#800080][b]USAGE NOTES[/b][/color]

This version of BitTorrent Sync is mainly intended for server usage. It allows to start one or more BitTorrent Sync daemons based on configuration files located in [font=courier new', courier, monospace][b]/etc/btsync[/b][/font]

The package installation offers a possibility to create a default instance of BitTorrent Sync. All relevant parameters can be specified interactively during the installation. At any time, the configuration of the default instance can be changed by executing the command:
[code]
`which sudo` dpkg-reconfigure btsync
[/code]

When creating configuration files manually, there are some possibilities to specify additional configuration parameters.

Configuration parameters not parsed by BitTorrent Sync but by the daemon init script can be supplied as comments in the configuration file.

The following parameters are supported:
[LIST]
[*][b]DAEMON_UID[/b]: A uid for specifying the user under which the btsync daemon should run[/*]
[*][b]DAEMON_GID[/b]: A gid for specifying the group under which the btsync daemon should run. If omitted the daemon will run under the primary group of the user[/*]
[*][b]DAEMON_UMASK[/b]: The umask (up to 4 octal digits) for the btsync daemon. If omitted the default umask is used.[/*]
[*][b]DAEMON_DEBUG[/b]: The debug mask (4 hex digits) for the btsync daemon. If omitted the init script will not touch potential settings defined manually. If set to [b]0000[/b], a potential settings file will be deleted. Full detail is set by specifying [b]FFFF[/b][/*]
[/LIST]
The parameter definition must use an equal sign ("="):
[code]
//
// DAEMON_UID=jdoe
// DAEMON_UMASK=0002
//
[/code]

This example will launch the instance running under the credentials of the user "[b]jdoe[/b]" using [b]0002[/b] as umask.

The old mechanism using the encoding in the configuration file name following the naming scheme

[b][font=courier new', courier, monospace]<damon name>[.<user>[.<group>]].conf[/font][/b]

is still supported but is superseded by data supplied in the configuration file itself. Support [b]WILL[/b] be dismissed in future releases. [b]PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS METHOD ANY MORE AND UPGRADE YOUR EXISTING CONFIGURATIONS![/b]

By specifying [font=courier new', courier, monospace][b]<user>[/b][/font] and [font=courier new', courier, monospace][b]<group>[/b][/font] it is possible to specify under which credentials the daemon runs. In this case it [b]MUST[/b] be assured that the daemon is able to read and write all files he has to access:

[LIST=1]
[*]The daemon must be able to read his own configuration file. Since the configuration file may contain sensitive data (the userame and password for the web interface), it is usually [b]owned by the user[/b] under which the daemon runs and has the mode [font=courier new', courier, monospace][b]400 (-r--------)[/b][/font] in order to limit the access to the specific user.[/*]
[*]The daemon must be able to read and write in his [font=courier new', courier, monospace][b]storage_path[/b][/font], since all internal control and status files (and the database of file hashes) are kept there. The ideal solution is to keep the storage_path somewhere in the home directory of the user under which the daemon will run.[/*]
[*]Obviously the daemon must be able to read and write into the directories that will be synchronized.[/*]
[/LIST]

Some example configuration files are provided under

[font=courier new', courier, monospace][b]/etc/btsync/samples[/b][/font]

The file [font=courier new', courier, monospace][b]/etc/default/btsync[/b][/font] allows to configure the way the daemon starts:

The variable [b]AUTOSTART[/b] defines which daemons are started automatically.
It can assume the values:
[LIST]
[*][font=courier new', courier, monospace][b]none [/b][/font]No daemon is started automatically[/*]
[*][font=courier new', courier, monospace][b]all [/b][/font](default) All daemons are started automatically[/*]
[*][font=courier new', courier, monospace][b]<list> [/b][/font]Only the specified daemons are started automatically[/*]
[/LIST]
The variable [b]DAEMON_ARGS[/b] allows to specify additional command line parameters passed to the daemon.

Please look also at the sample configuration files installed in [font=courier new', courier, monospace][b]/etc/btsync/samples[/b][/font].

The additional configuration file [font=courier new', courier, monospace][b]/etc/default/btsync[/b][/font] permits to specify which btsync instances should be started automatically and to specify some additional parameters to pass to the btsync daemon. The default setting is to start all instances. Additional documentation can be found in the file:
[code]
# This is the configuration file for /etc/init.d/btsync
#
# Start only these btsync instances automatically via
# init script.
# Allowed values are "all", "none" or space separated list of
# names of the instances. If empty, "all" is assumed.
#
# The instance name refers to the btsync configuration file name.
# i.e. "general" would be /etc/btsync/general.conf
#
#AUTOSTART="all"
#AUTOSTART="none"
#AUTOSTART="general special"
#
# Optional arguments to btsync's command line. Be careful!
# You should only add thngs here if you know EXACTLY what
# you are doing!
DAEMON_ARGS=""
#
# Enable this to see more output during the init script
# execution
#DAEMON_INIT_DEBUG=1
[/code]


[color=#ff0000][b]SOME ADDITIONAL WORDS ABOUT AUTOUPDATE[/b][/color]

The daemon scripts require that autoupdate is disabled in the configuration script, otherwise the instance will not be started. The reason for that is, that updates are handled by the Debian/Ubuntu package handling utility itself.

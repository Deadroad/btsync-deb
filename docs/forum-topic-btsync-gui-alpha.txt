Ladies and Gentlemen!
 
I'm pleased to announce, that the waiting is over! The alpha test of [font='courier new', courier, monospace][b]btsync-gui[/b][/font] starts today. I will not spend many words. I prefer to let speak the images:

[b]OBLIGATORY DISCLAIMER:[/b]
 
[color=#ff0000][b]THIS APPLICATION IS UNOFFICIAL AND NOT THE WORK OF BITTORRENT® INC. PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT THE BITTORRENT® INC. SUPPORT WITH QUESTIONS OR PROBLEMS RELATED TO THE USE OF THE APPLICATION. YOU WILL FIND COMPETENT HELP AND SUPPORT IN THIS THREAD[/b][/color]
 
[b]AUDIENCE:[/b]
 
Since the software has never been tested by anyone but me, only experienced linux user should participate in this alpha test during the first weeks...
 
[b]COMPATIBILITY:[/b]
 
Currently the application has been tested by me on the following distributions:
[LIST]
[*]Debian Wheezy with Gnome Desktop[/*]
[*]Ubuntu Raring 13.04 with Unity Desktop[/*]
[*]Linux Mint Petra with Cinnamon Desktop[/*]
[/LIST]
Other users have reported successful installations on:
[LIST]
[*]Xubuntu 13.10 with OpenBox+Tint2[/*]
[*]Debian Jessie with KDE[/*]
[*]Ubuntu 14.04 with Cinnamon[/*]
[/LIST]
Now it's up to you to test it and give me lots of feedback in order to extend this list.
 
[b]FEATURES:[/b]
 
The application aims to be a clone of the GUI on Windows and Mac OSX and to replace on long term the package [font='courier new', courier, monospace][b]btsync-user[/b][/font]. This alpha release offers the minimum feature set needed to work with BitTorrent Sync. The following features are still [b]not implemented[/b]:
[LIST=1]
[*]Editing of predefined hosts[/*]
[*]Creation of one time secrets (I still have no idea how to implement it...)[/*]
[*]GUI is still only available in English[/*]
[*][s]The whole "Devices" tab[/s][/*]
[*]The whole "Transfers" tab[/*]
[*]The whole "History" tab[/*]
[/LIST]
[b]All the other features should work.[/b]
 
[b]HOW TO INSTALL:[/b]
 
If you have already added one of the Debian/Ubuntu repositories [url=http://forum.bittorrent.com/topic/19560-debian-and-ubuntu-desktop-unofficial-packages-for-bittorrent-sync/][b]following the instructions in this post[/b][/url], you have only to add the following additional lines to the source definition file:
 


[code=auto:0]deb http://debian.yeasoft.net/btsync experimental main
deb-src http://debian.yeasoft.net/btsync experimental main
[/code]
 
Then you should update your package index:
 
[code=auto:0]sudo apt-get update
[/code]
 
After updating the package index, you can install btsync-gui with:
 
[code=auto:0]sudo apt-get install btsync-gui
[/code]
 
or
 
[code=auto:0]sudo apt-get install btsync-gui-gtk
[/code]
 
if you do not want to use [font='courier new', courier, monospace][b]libappindicator[/b][/font] - but you can do this only if you are using a GTK based desktop like Gnome on Debian. [b]THIS WILL DEFINITIVELY NOT WORK WITH DESKTOPS LIKE UNITY[/b]! If you are in doubt, install [font='courier new', courier, monospace][b]btsync-gui[/b][/font] - this will work for sure!
 
The application will replace [b]btsync-user[/b] (if installed) without losing the already configured folder shares.

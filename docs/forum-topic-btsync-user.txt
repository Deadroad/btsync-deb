[color=#4b0082][b]BTSYNC PACKAGES FOR DEBIAN, UBUNTU AND OTHER DERIVED DISTRIBUTIONS[/b][/color]

If you are using Ubuntu, Debian, Raspian or other derived distributions based on Debian and you are searching for an easy way to deploy BitTorrent Sync on your systems, this topic is definitively for you. Here you will find information about a family of easy to install deb-packages that offers both a solution for the need of typical server/cloud operators as for interactive users.

The [b]desktop user packages[/b] are explicitly intended for [b]desktop usage[/b] and provide a user experience similar to BitTorrent Sync on Windows or Mac OSX by still giving the user the possibility to customise his installation if he has special needs.

The [b]server packages[/b] offer full debconf-support for the automated creation and maintenance of an optional default configuration as well as the possibility to manually configure single or multiple BitTorrent Sync instances with highly customised configurations.

This topic covers only the [b]desktop user packages[/b]. If you are searching for the [b]server packages,[/b] [url=http://forum.bittorrent.com/topic/18974-debian-and-ubuntu-server-packages-for-bittorrent-sync/][b]please look here[/b][/url].

[color=#ff0000][b]THESE PACKAGES ARE UNOFFICIAL AND NOT THE WORK OF BITTORRENT® INC. PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT THE BITTORRENT® INC. SUPPORT WITH QUESTIONS OR PROBLEMS RELATED TO THE USE OF THE PACKAGES. YOU WILL FIND COMPETENT HELP AND SUPPORT IN THIS THREAD[/b][/color]


[color=#008000][b]INSTALLATION ON DEBIAN, UBUNTU, LINUX MINT, RASPBIAN OR OTHER DEBIAN DERIVATES[/b][/color]

The most easy and fast way to install the repository is to paste that at a terminal prompt:
[code]
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL http://debian.yeasoft.net/add-btsync-repository.sh)"
[/code]
 
The script explains what it will do and then pauses before it does it asking for your permission. If you encounter any problems or prefer to do it manually, please [b][url=http://www.yeasoft.com/site/projects:btsync-deb:btsync-repo]look here[/url][/b].

Now update the package index and install [font=courier new,courier,monospace][b]btsync[/b][/font] by pasting that at a terminal prompt:
[code]
`which sudo` apt-get update
`which sudo` apt-get install btsync-user
[/code]

After the successful installation, you have to initially start BitTorrent Sync. You have different possibilities to do this:
[LIST]
[*]Log out and login again. Since BitTorrent Sync is started on logon, it will start automatically.[/*]
[*]Select [i]BitTorrent Sync[/i] from the menu or Unity-Launcher[/*]
[*]Start it from the terminal prompt by issuing the command:[/*]
[/LIST]

[code]
btsync start
[/code]



[color=#800080][b]USAGE NOTES[/b][/color]

This package of BitTorrent Sync is explicitly intended for generic desktop usage and provide a user experience similar to BitTorrent Sync on Windows or Mac OSX: When the user logs in, an instance of BitTorrent Sync is automatically launched under the user's credentials and a tray applet is launched to show the status and manage the running instance.

By default the user instance has an automatical created configuration file in [font='courier new', courier, monospace][b]~/.config/btsync/btsync-auto.conf[/b][/font] and keeps its internal data in the directory [font='courier new', courier, monospace][b]~/.btsync[/b][/font]

A user specific desktop shortcut to the web UI is installed into the system. Since every user has it's web UI on a different port number, only the desktop shortcut or the indicator applet should be used to invoke the web UI.

In order to give more freedom to the advanced user, there is also a possibility to launch BitTorrent Sync with a custom configuration file instead of the automatically created file: the startup routine of BitTorrent Sync checks, if there is a file named [b][font='courier new', courier, monospace]btsync-user.conf[/font][/b] in the configuration directory [font='courier new', courier, monospace][b]~/.config/btsync[/b][/font] of the user. If this file is found, then it is used as configuration file. If not, BitTorrent Sync uses the automatically created default configuration file [b][font='courier new', courier, monospace]~/.config/btsync/btsync-auto.conf[/font][/b] that will be recreated on every restart.

The most easy way to create a custom configuration file, is to create a copy of the automatically created configuration file and then to edit it according to your needs:
[code]
cp ~/.config/btsync/btsync-auto.conf ~/.config/btsync/btsync-user.conf
nano -w ~/.config/btsync/btsync-user.conf
[/code]

When you are ready with your modifications, you can restart BitTorrent Sync by executing:
[code]
btsync restart
[/code]
on the command line.

In addition to the desktop shortcuts and menu functions in the indicator applet, BitTorrent Sync can also be controlled from the command line using the tool [font=courier, monospace][b]btsync[/b][/font]. The tool provides usage instructions by issuing the command:
[code]
btsync -h
[/code]

More comprehensive help can be found on the corresponding manpage:
[code]
man btsync
[/code]

==============

The BitTorrent Server Package was written by Leo Moll <leo.moll@yeasoft.com>

### Main Inspiration ###

The main structure of this deployment was inspired by the OpenVPN package for
Debian. In OpenVPN, you define your VPN instances by specifying configuration
files in /etc/openvpn and so I adopted the same mechanism for BitTorrent Sync.

### Contributions ###

suggestions and providing some eccellent ideas.
